# Competitive Programming Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various competitive programming problems. Each solution is written in a separate file and named after the problem name or ID.

## Table of Contents

- [Languages Used](#languages-used)

## Languages Used

I mainly use C++ for solving problems, but you may also find solutions written in other languages such as Python or C.

## Structure

The repository is organized into directories, one for each online judge or contest platform. Within each directory, the problems are organized into subdirectories according to their category (e.g., data structures, dynamic programming, graph theory, etc.).

Each solution file is named after the problem ID or name, and contains the code that solves the problem. Some files may also include comments or explanations about the approach used.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find a bug or want to improve an existing solution, feel free to submit a pull request.
